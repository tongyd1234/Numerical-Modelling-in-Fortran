# Numerical-Modelling-in-Fortran
Lecture notes and codes for the course "Numerical Modelling in Fortran" given by Prof. Paul Tackley, ETH Zurich
This repository contains the lecture notes from the course "Numerical Modelling in Fortran" given by Prof. Paul Tackley, ETH Zurich. 
The folders with number contain the lecture slides for each week. 
The folder "Fortran Exercise" contains the exercises for each lecture. 
The topics covered in this lecture are:
