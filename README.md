# Numerical-Modelling-in-Fortran
Lecture notes and codes for the course "Numerical Modelling in Fortran" given by Prof. Paul Tackley, ETH Zurich

This repository contains the lecture notes from the course "Numerical Modelling in Fortran" given by Prof. Paul Tackley, ETH Zurich. 

The folders with number contain the lecture slides for each week. 
The folder "Fortran Exercise" contains the exercises for each lecture. 

The topics covered in this lecture are:
Fortran Topics： history, basics，interactive I/O, do loops, functions&subroutines，modules, ascii file I/O, array functions, assumed size arrays,precision, formatted I/O, derived types, keyword&optional arguments, character string manipulation, recursive functions, binary I/O, makefiles, intrinsic functions, pointers, writing fast code (optimisation), pure procedures, elemental procedures, generic procedures, operators and overloading, parallel computing (MPI & Co-array), object-oriented programming: parameterised data types, type extension, polymorphism, type-bound procedures, data hiding	OOP exercises, access to environment, interoperability with C, FPE handling, restructure convection program using OOP, useful libraries.

Numerical Topics: finite differences, 1-D & 2-D diffusion equations, streamfunction, upwind advection, 2-D advection-diffusion, iterative & multigrid solvers, Jacobi & Gauss-Seidel iterations, program 2D Poisson solver, convection (2-D, infinite-Prandtl), finite (low) Prandtl number convection, OOP exercises, restructure convection program using OOP and implicit time-stepping.

This course gives an introduction to programming in this language, and is suitable for students who have only minimal programming experience, for example with MATLAB scripts. The focus will be on Fortran 95, but Fortran 77 will also be covered for those working with already-existing codes. A hands-on approach will be emphasized rather than abstract concepts, using example scientific problems relevant to Earth science.
